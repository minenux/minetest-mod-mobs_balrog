## About 

This mod added a configurable big BIG moster to defeat, 
taken it from the Lord of The Rings game and reworked it a bit.

was originally made by Hamlet but abandoned, now minimal fixed 
for VenenuX minetest game, https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=18459

## Usage

**Spawn chance**: 1 en a thousand (same the chance of being struck 
by a lightning in real life) under -1500 on the ground, but if nether then 
will be 1 in half a thousand under -8000 on the ground.

**Lowered stats**: HP range to a min of 200 to a max of 600; if you are 
alone then you are dead, if you are in a party you might defeat it. 
Maybe. It's a deity after all.

The mob is configurable by settings, check [settingtypes.txt](settingtypes.txt) file.

* `mobs_balrog:balrog` : the balrog deity!
* `mobs_balrog:balrog_whip` : the balrog whip weapon
